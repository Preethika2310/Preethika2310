- ⚡ About my Journey I recently graduated from R.M.K.Engineering College with the specialization of Computer Science and Design and I have undergone training in the domain of GenAI. I built a strong foundation in core development tools including Python, Flask, SQL, and Git. I explored Generative AI concepts and progressed into agentic AI frameworks such as LangChain, AutoGen, and n8n, designing modular workflows and multi-agent orchestration systems. This experience sharpened my ability to translate AI capabilities into practical, production-ready tools.
